Problem 1

{r}
redline <- read.csv("redlining.csv")
lm_model <- lm(policies ~ minority + fire + age + income, data= redline)
coef(lm_model)

ggplot(redline, aes(x = policies, y = minority)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")



confint(lm_model)

We are answering the question is the number of FAIR policies associated with racial/ethnic composition of a ZIP Code. 
The statistical tool I used was a linear model to interpret this interaction. I then made a scatter-plot of the relationship 
between policies and minority and fitted the model into an equation. I then checked whether or not the slopes of different 
confounding variables were in the 95% confidence interval. Based on the scatter-plot, there seems to be a strong positive linear 
correlation between policies and minorities. The slope of the minorities variable is positive even at 2.5% confidence level so it 
would likely to assume there is a correlation between policies and minorities. The slope of the line is 0.00836 which means for 
every 1 person who identifies as a minority there is 0.836% increase in policies.

Problem 2

Part A

{r}
groceries <- read.csv("groceries.csv")

avg_price_per_store <- groceries %>% 
  group_by(Store) %>% 
  summarise(avg_price = mean(Price))

ggplot(avg_price_per_store, aes(x = avg_price, y = Store)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(x = "Average Price of Products", y = "Store", 
       title = "Average Price of Products Across Different Stores") + coord_flip() + 
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))


Part B

{r}
stores_per_product <- groceries %>%
  group_by(Product) %>%
  summarise(Num_Stores = n_distinct(Store))

ggplot(stores_per_product, aes(x = Num_Stores, y = Product)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Number of Stores Selling Product", y = "Product",
       title = "Number of Stores Selling Each Product")  + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

Part C

{r}

new_model <- lm(formula = Price ~ Product + Type, data = groceries)
confint(new_model, level=0.95, "TypeGrocery", multiplicative=TRUE)




Compared with ordinary grocery stores (like Albertsons, HEB, or Krogers), convenience stores charge 
somewhere between $0.41 and $0.92 dollars more for the same product.

Part D

{r}

lm_model <- lm(Price ~ Product + Store, data = groceries)
store_coef <- coef(lm_model)[grep("Store", names(coef(lm_model)))]
sorted_coef <- sort(store_coef)

lowest_price_stores <- names(sorted_coef)[1:2]
highest_price_stores <- names(sorted_coef)[(length(sorted_coef)-1):length(sorted_coef)]

lowest_price_stores
highest_price_stores


The two stores that charge the lowest prices when compared to the same product is Walmart and Kroger Fresh Fare. 
The two stores that charge the highest prices when compared to the same project are Whole Foods and Wheatsville Food Co-Op.

Part E

{r}
lm_model <- lm(Price ~ Product + Store, data = groceries)
coef_CM <- coef(lm_model)["StoreCentral Market"]
coef_HEB <- coef(lm_model)[grep("StoreH-E-B", names(coef(lm_model)))]

# Print the coefficients
cat("Coefficient for Central Market:", coef_CM, "\n")
cat("Coefficient for H-E-B:", coef_HEB, "\n")

coef_WF <- coef(lm_model)["StoreWhole Foods"]
cat("\nFor Comparison: Coefficient for Whole Foods:", coef_WF, "\n")


Central Market charges a similar amount to HEB for the same product. Difference between the two stores is $.073 
on average for the same product. Compared to the price of the product at Whole Foods the difference could account for about $1.

Part F

{r}
groceries <- groceries %>% 
  mutate(Income10K = Income/10000)

linear_model <- lm(Price ~ Product + Income10K, data = groceries)

coef(linear_model)["Income10K"]

summary(linear_model)$coefficients["Income10K", "Std. Error"]

coef(linear_model)["Income10K"] / summary(linear_model)$coefficients["Income10K", "Std. Error"]



Customers in poorer ZIP Codes pay less for the same product on average because the coefficient is
negative for the variable Income10K. One-standard deviation increase in the income of a ZIP code seems 
to be associated with a -1.464 standard-deviation change in the price that consumers in that ZIP code 
expect to pay for the same product.
